# clj-devenv

configuration-driven clojure development environment.

The objective of `clj-devenv` is to minimize the complexity of managing
development environments and keeping `user.clj` clean. Templating and
bootstrapping is bad idea for managing development environment because it's
often changes as time passes.

## Status

- [x] Hot-reload set of dirs and reload changed files
- [x] Support [integrant] and [duct framework] state management.
- [x] Easy configuration language.
- [ ] Replace hawk with [beholder].
- [ ] Wrap [nrepl] and [cider-nrepl] and expose start function.
- [ ] Wrap [viso/pretty] for pretty print exceptions.
- [ ] Support running and watching tests, maybe wrap [kaocha].
- [ ] Support [mount].

## Usage

### 1. Create `user.clj`

```clojure
(ns user
 (:require [devenv.core]
           [potemkin]))

(potemkin/import-vars ;; expose api functions in user namespace. (e.g. user/start )
 [devenv.core init start pause resume stop restart watch system config])

;; initialized with default options
(init)

(comment
  ;; Map of current state. Most likely would be only integrant state.
  system
  ;; Set refresh-dirs, start state, load local.clj if it exists.
  ;; Pass true as first argument to start watch process.
  ;; Alias: go
  (start)
  ;; Stop the development environment, clear state and namespace tracker.
  ;; Pass false as first argument to keep current watch job running if any.
  ;; Alias: halt!, halt
  (stop)
  ;; Restart development environment by running (stop) and start.
  ;; Pass true as first argument to restart watch job too.
  ;; Alias: reset-all
  (restart)
  ;; Pause state, "only effective with state management".
  ;; alias: suspend
  (pause)
  ;; Resume state after pausing, "only effective with state management".
  (resume)
  ;; Refresh development environment by running (pause) and (start).
  ;; alias: reset
  (refrsh)
  ;; Start watching `:watch-paths` for changes. If development environment
  ;; isn't started yet, then run (start).
  (watch)
  ;; Stop watching `:watch-paths` for changes.
  (watch :stop))
```

### 2. Create alias in `deps.edn`
```clojure
{:aliases
 :repl {:main-opts   ["-m" "nrepl.cmdline" "--middleware"
                      "[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware]" "--interactive"]
        :extra-paths ["test" "dev/src"]
        :extra-deps  {cider/cider-nrepl {:mvn/version "0.27.2"}
                      tami5/devenv      {:mvn/version "0.1.0"}}}}
```


## Default Options

```clojure
{;; By default only watch and namespace reload and refresh works
 ;; Paths to target for refresh & tests
 :paths ["src" "test" "dev" "resources" "dev/src" "dev/resources"]
 ;; Whether to auto-start i.e. when calling devenv/init, call devenv/start
 :start-on-init? false ;;

 ;; Directories to watch for changes. default to :paths
 :watch-paths nil ;; vector
 ;; File patterns to trigger reload on.
 :watch-pattern #"[^.].*(\.clj|\.edn)$"
 ;; time stamp format, set to nil if you don't want have timestamp.
 :watch-timestamp "[hh:mm:ss]"

 ;; Integrant file configuration path within :paths.
 :integrant-file-path nil ;; string
 ;; integrant profiles.
 :integrant-profiles nil ;; vector
 ;; Whether duct framework should be considered.
 :integrant-with-duct? nil} ;; boolean
```

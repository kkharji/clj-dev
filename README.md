# Devenv

Library for setting up development environment (e.g. watching source code, running tests ..).
Mostly used to quickly setup my development environment with/without integrant/duct.

## Usage

### Options

```clojure
{:env/paths ;; Runtime Paths
 ["src" "test" "dev" "resources" "dev/src" "dev/resources"]

 ;; Watch Configuration
 :watch/paths nil ;; directories to watch for changes. default to :env/paths
 :watch/pattern #"[^.].*(\.clj|\.edn)$"  ;; file patterns to trigger reload on write
 :watch/timestamp "[hh:mm:ss]" ;; Set to nil if you don't want have timestamp with each library action.

 ;; Integrant/Duct Configuration
 :integrant/prep nil ;; A function that would be executed within integrant.repl/set-prep!
 :integrant/file-path nil ;; integrant file configuration path within runtime paths.
 :integrant/profiles nil ;; integrant profiles.
 :integrant/with-duct? nil} ;; whether duct framework is used
```

### Quick Start

#### user.clj

```clojure
(ns user
 (:require [tami5.devenv :as devenv]
           [potemkin :as potemkin]))

(potemkin/import-vars ;; make it accessible in user.clj namespace
 [devenv init start pause resume stop restart watch])

;; Initialized with defaults (only refresh-dirs and watch can be used.)
(init {})

(comment
  (start)        ;; start the development environment
  (pause)        ;; pause, only effective with integrant/duct
  (resume)       ;; resume after pausing, only effective
  (stop)         ;; stop the development environment
  (restart)      ;; restart by running stop and then start.
  (watch)        ;; start hot-reload
  (watch         ;; stop hot-reload
    :stop))
```
